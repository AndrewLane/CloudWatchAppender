    <description>As of 5.0, services are divided into separate packages. This is a legacy package, containing updated AWSAppender.CloudWatch, AWSAppender.CloudWatchLogs and AWSAppender.Core. It is recommended you include those libraries as individual packages. You can also use this package to reference older versions, 4.0 and below.
    
    A CloudWatch appender for log4net. You can configure log4net to direct your log events to CloudWatch, making them show up as data points on a graph.

    <summary>An AWS CloudWatch appender for log4net.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>CloudWatchAppender, in future to be known as the AWSAppender-suite, has gone through a major rehaul separating the supported AWS services into their own packages, as well as adding two: SNS and SQS. Now you can use log4net to send messages across your distributed infrastructure.</releaseNotes>
